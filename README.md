## Repository Contents

### Analysis Notebook
The `analysis.ipynb` notebook contains data exploration, preprocessing steps, and visualization of the dataset. It covers aspects such as data loading, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical ones for machine learning compatibility.

### Modelling Notebook
The `modelling 1.ipynb` notebook is focused on creating and evaluating machine learning models. It includes data splitting, feature scaling, model creation (utilizing algorithms like Gradient Boosting Regressor, LGBM Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor), and model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error.

### Dataset
The raw dataset (`ford.csv`) is included in this repository. It forms the basis for the analysis and prediction tasks.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aliraqimustafa/car-price-prediction.git```
2. **Navigate to the Repository:**

   ```sh
   cd car-price-prediction```
3. **Run the Notebooks:**
    - Open analysis.ipynb and modelling 1.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
